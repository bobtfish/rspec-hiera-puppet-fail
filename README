Failing test code demonstrating issues with rspec-puppet and rspec-hiera-puppet

To test:

bundle install
./runpuppet.sh

(Should create /tmp/foo)

Then:

cd modules/foo
bundle exec rake spec # Tests fail
Comment the line: "require 'rspec-hiera-puppet'" out in spec/spec_helper.rb
bundle exec rake spec # Tests now pass

This seems to be: https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet/issues/44, but I think
the issue is in https://github.com/amfranz/rspec-hiera-puppet/blob/master/lib/rspec-hiera-puppet/puppet.rb

Not sure how this is even supposed to work!
